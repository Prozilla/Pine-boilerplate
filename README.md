# Pine boilerplate

This repository contains boilerplate code for building an application using the Pine engine.

## Getting started

1. Create a file called `gradle.properties` with the following content:

    ```properties
    gpr.user=USERNAME
    gpr.token=TOKEN
    ```

2. Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `TOKEN` with your personal access token. For more information, read [Working with the Gradle registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry).

3. You can now run the project by using the following command:

    > ```gradle run```
