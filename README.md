# Pine boilerplate

This repository contains boilerplate code for a project using the Pine engine.

## Getting started

Create a file called `gradle.properties` with the following content:

```properties
gpr.user=USERNAME
gpr.token=TOKEN
```

Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `TOKEN` with your personal access token. For more information, read [Working with the Gradle registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry).

Once that's done, you can now run the project by running the following command:

> ```gradle run```
